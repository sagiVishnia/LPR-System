IMPORTANT!!!

The current repository contains the source code of my BS.c final project.
In this project we worked with real images of patients, received from a hospital. Due to a confidentiality agreement we can not post real photos
to run the system with. This repository shows the source code for your impression only.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Description:

My teammate and I built a system that receives endoscopic images and uses a convolutional neural network to diagnose whether the patient was suffering from "LPR" disease or not.
The project was implemented in Python and made use of NumPy, OpenCV, and TensorFlow libraries.
