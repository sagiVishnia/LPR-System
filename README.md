IMPORTANT!!!

The current repository contains the source code of my B.Sc. final project.
In this project we worked with real images of patients, received from a hospital. Due to a confidentiality agreement we can not post real photos
to run the system with. This repository shows the source code for your impression only.
Also, the project book is attached as pdf with full explanations of the system.

Description:

My teammate and I built a system that receives endoscopic images and uses a convolutional neural network to diagnose whether the patient was suffering from "LPR" disease or not.
The project was implemented in Python and made use of NumPy, OpenCV, and TensorFlow libraries.
